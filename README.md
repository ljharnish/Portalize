# What is it?
Originally developed by Heaval and Rexet Studio for Web and Android, and released in 2012,

Portalize is a puzzle and logic game to bring the experience of Valve's Portal and Portal 2 games to everyone.

However, the game became unmaintained and left to fade away...

**Until now!**

# Portalize: Remastered
Is a new and improved version of Portalize that will be available for most platforms, including PC!

However this repo is not going to be updated any time soon as I don't have time to work on this..

Meaning someone can take over and make their own build of Portalize, which gives amazing mod capabilities, level creation abilities, and even creating more DLC maps!

Hopefully someone finds this and finishes it..
